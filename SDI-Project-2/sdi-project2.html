<p>I chose to continue with the same theme that I did last week. Nothing this week went well. The concept of "Functions" just didn't click to me. I had a super hard time creating an Array Function because I kept on getting the same error over and over. I guess that's part of being a coder, right? I tried online resources, but didn't get much help since I had a hard time explaining what I needed help with even to myself. I'm still not 100% certain if I get it, but I tried my best. The things that didn't go so well was pretty much everything. As the weeks progress, I'm getting more and more excited (and overwhelmed) of how these projects are molding me to become the developer I want to become.</p>
