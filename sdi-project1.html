<p>The theme I chose was how I take care of my daughter. The reason why I chose this as my theme was because it was the easiest one I could think of. Throughout the day I'm faced with actions and choices. Each of which results in some type of reaction. Also, taking care of my daughter consumes my day, making it an easy theme to report on.</p>
